--> Meeting Scheduler (Python)

This is a small Python project that schedules meetings based on user input.
The program works in a conversational way and behaves like a simple intelligent agent.

I created this project to practice Python logic, conditions, and data handling.

--> What this project does

Takes meeting request from the user

Asks for missing details like date or time

Checks if the meeting time is already booked

Schedules the meeting if the time is free

Prevents time conflicts

This project is rule-based, not machine learning based.

--> Technologies used

Python 3

Dictionary and list

Basic string handling

Conditional statements

--> Project files
calendar.py   -> stores meeting data
helper.py    -> helper functions
agent.py     -> main scheduling logic
main.py      -> runs the program

--> How to run

Make sure Python is installed

Open terminal in project folder

--> Run the command:

python main.py

***Example output
You: schedule meeting tomorrow
Agent: Please tell the meeting time.

You: 2
Agent: That time is already booked. Try another time.

You: 4
Agent: Meeting scheduled successfully.

-->Learning outcome

Through this project, I learned:

How to break a problem into steps

How to manage user input

How to use logic to make decisions

How simple programs can behave intelligently

-->Future improvements

Save meetings to a file

Support multiple days

Improve input handling

Add a simple user interface
